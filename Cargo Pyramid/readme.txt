Industry set with industry chain arranged into a pyramid scheme of 4 levels.

1st level:
18 primary industries. Can accept passengers to increase production. Each two passengers produce one extra item of cargo.

2nd level:
6 secondary industries. Each one item of all three accepted cargos produces one item of output cargo.
Needs all three cargos to produce otherwise delivered cargo will slowly decay.

3rd level:
2 secondary industries. Each one item of all three accepted cargos produces one item of output cargo.
Needs all three cargos to produce otherwise delivered cargo will slowly decay.
Produces faster than level 2 and decays slower.

4th level:
1 secondary industry. Two items of all two accepted cargos produces one item of output cargo.
Needs both cargos to produce otherwise delivered cargo will decay fast.
Produces very slowly and decays faster.
Output cargo is delivered to final industry that does not produce anything.
