NewGRF was primarily used for Novapolis special event game in 2014.

Use only for Arctic climate!
There is no check for climate and will work for other, but there might be no gold mine.


Takes one parameter that should be set to starting year of the game.

Alters gold mine based on the year of the game.

Gold mine accepts passengers to produce gold. Each 2 passengers produce 1 gold

Every 2.5 days 1/8 of waiting passengers produce gold.

Running year of the game:             Maximum theoretical production per month
0-2  Accept up to    50 passengers      26 gold
3-5  Accept up to   150 passengers      78 gold
6-7  Accept up to   250 passengers     130 gold
8-9  Accept up to   450 passengers     242 gold
10+  Accept up to 10000 passengers    5419 gold

Gold cargo payment is changed
If time delivery is more than 100 days delivery is not profit but loss.


Profit coefficient based on running year of the game:
0-2   2×
3-5   3×
6-8   8×, delivery time over 100 days generate loss
9+   19×, delivery time over 100 days generate loss
